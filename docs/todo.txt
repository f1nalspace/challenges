Todo-List:

- Make first enemy and play around with AI

- Fast quad and sprite rendering using a vertex buffer
- Entity sprites
- Sprite animations
- Make first collectible
- Shooting bubbles with the ability to stand on
- Menu for starting and exiting the game
- Options menu for toggling sound, setting volume.
- Play sounds and music (required XAudio support in FPL)
	-> Generate sounds from the web, there are plenty of sites out there with 8-bit generators.

Notes:

- Leave the renderer as it is, opengl 1.x is fine and i dont need command rendering for now.
