Todo-List:

- Fast quad and sprite rendering using a vertex buffer
- Move to a tilemap based level system for rendering and creating the walls and platforms
	-> Use bitmaps for tile editor for now
- Drawing actual sprites for the level (Use the sprites from leverman and make it 16 palette ones)
	- Sprite animations!
- Make first collectible
- Make first enemy and play around with AI
- Shooting bubbles with the ability to stand on
- Render debug infos on the screen with a history thingy
- Debug quake like console?
- Menu for starting and exiting the game
- Options menu for toggling sound, setting volume.
- Play sounds and music (required XAudio support in FPL)
	-> Generate sounds from the web, there are plenty of sites out there with 8-bit generators.

Notes:

- Leave the renderer as it is, opengl 1.x is fine and i dont need command rendering for now.
